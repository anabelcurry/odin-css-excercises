/* What I would have done differently:
my version is unneccessarily verbose. The information class is unneeded and
ultimately creates a need to flip the flex-direction 3 times which is not dry.

The solution version skips wrapping the whole thing in a container and just uses
text-align: center on the body element, that way it stays as a block element.
So I could cut this whole .information section*/

because I had other padding/margins) but having it here is simpler if I was not
to have the extra container for alignment */

/* If I did the above change, this would be the first use of display:flex and
it's associated justify content but would no longer need to switch directions.
I would also not have to center because it would come from the body element. 
They also use gap instead of padding but my pixel count is similar 60px vs 52px. */

/* Again I would be able to eliminate the declaration of flex and change of
direction. as well as the alignment because it would come from the body element. 
Margin would be handled by the gap of the previous rule. The width is correct 
px wise but they use max width which is more flexible on
resize. */
